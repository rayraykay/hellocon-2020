    "description": "The world abounds in novel products targeting the internet of things (IoT). Fundamentally, these products are networks, consisting of edge devices (sensing and actuation), a cloud backend (data flow), and compute facilities located somewhere in the network. Although placing compute in the cloud is commonly done for flexibility and ease of development, there are significant advantages to edge computation. This talk by Nebu J. Mathai will cover an advanced example of edge computation for a high-performance and high compute bandwidth sensor network. The technology---a supercomputer-on-chip for the rapid, real-time, multi-stream inferencing from RF and microwave signals---will be presented with particular focus on processor architecture.",
